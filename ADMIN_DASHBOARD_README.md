{
  name: string,
  phone: string,

}
```

{
  projectTitle: string,
  balance: number,
  fundGoal: number,

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This dashboard provides full access to your Firebase data. In production:

1. **Implement Authentication**: Add user authentication before allowing access
2. **Role-Based Access**: Restrict access to admin users only
3. **Firebase Security Rules**: Configure proper Firestore security rules
4. **Environment Variables**: Ensure Firebase config is properly secured

## Customization

### Adding New Fields
To add new fields to any entity:

1. Update the `formSchemas` object in `AdminDashboard.jsx`
2. Add the field to the appropriate schema
3. The form and table will automatically update

### Modifying Validation
Customize form validation by modifying the `handleInputChange` function and adding validation logic.

### Styling Changes
The dashboard uses Tailwind CSS classes. Modify the className attributes to change the appearance.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Firebase Connection Error**
   - Check your Firebase configuration
   - Ensure environment variables are set correctly
   - Verify Firebase project permissions

2. **Data Not Loading**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify Firestore rules allow read operations
